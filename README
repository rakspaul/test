This is your new Play application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.

Since we have moved away from rails . So to install new scala compiler and updated play jar, do following
1. switch to branch sprint-1510
2. sbt ~run // it will download all jars

To compile the code (always before commiting ) do 
sbt dist

To run your projet on specific port
sbt "~run <port_no>"

To run the project on default part

sbt ~run

If the application doesn't get loaded in dev mode, Try follwowing steps -

 vi app/assets/javascripts/main.js 
   
    /**optimize: 'uglify2',
    uglify2: {
    warnings: false,
      mangle: false
    },**/
